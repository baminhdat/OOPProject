# Overview
This is the major assignment of the OOP course at School of Information and Communication Technology, HUST where we built a game using the Java language and basic OOP knowledges.
# Brief
The game is inspired by the great Journey to the West. The main character is San Zhang, who is apparently imprisoned by monsters. The player's task is to help him escape by finding the portal in a maze.
# Assets
The game used various assets from different sources: The Soul Knight games and tileset packages from itch.io. If there's a problem regarding Copyright, you can contact me at bminhdat03.p@gmail.com
